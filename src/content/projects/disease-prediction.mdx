# AI-Powered Disease Prediction

## The Problem

Traditional symptom-to-disease diagnosis relies heavily on medical expertise and can be time-consuming. Patients often struggle to understand their symptoms and need quick, reliable preliminary assessments before consulting healthcare professionals.

## The Approach

I developed a machine learning system that analyzes patient symptoms and predicts potential diseases with high accuracy. The solution involved:

- **Model Comparison**: Evaluated multiple algorithms including Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks
- **Cross-Validation**: Implemented k-fold validation to ensure robust performance across different data splits
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted meaningful symptom patterns and relationships

<Callout type="info">
The model achieved 95% accuracy on the test dataset, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.
</Callout>

## API Deployment

The prediction model was deployed as a RESTful API using Flask, featuring:

- **Fast Inference**: Optimized for sub-200ms response times at the 95th percentile
- **Scalable Architecture**: Containerized deployment with load balancing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and data sanitization

<Metric label="Response Time" value="<200ms p95" />
<Metric label="Accuracy" value="95%" />

## Feature Importance Analysis

Through feature importance analysis, I identified the most predictive symptoms for various disease categories:

- **Respiratory Issues**: Cough, fever, and breathing difficulty
- **Digestive Problems**: Nausea, abdominal pain, and appetite changes
- **Neurological Symptoms**: Headache, dizziness, and cognitive changes

## Results & Impact

The system successfully demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare diagnostics:

- **Improved Accessibility**: Provides preliminary assessments to underserved populations
- **Reduced Healthcare Burden**: Helps prioritize urgent cases
- **Educational Value**: Helps users understand symptom-disease relationships
