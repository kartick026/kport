## 🛠️ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Formspree Account
1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"**
3. Sign up with your email: `sharmakartick026@gmail.com`

### Step 2: Create a New Form
1. After signing up, click **"New Form"**
2. Give it a name: `Portfolio Contact Form`
3. Set **"Send to"** email: `sharmakartick026@gmail.com`
4. Click **"Create Form"**

### Step 3: Get Your Form ID
1. You'll see a form endpoint like: `https://formspree.io/f/xpzgkqwe`
2. Copy the **form ID** part: `xpzgkqwe`
3. This is what you need to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in the code

### Step 4: Update Your Code
Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in `src/app/contact/page.tsx` with your actual form ID.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Change this line:
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {

// To this (with your actual form ID):
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xpzgkqwe', {
```

   From: {{name}} ({{email}})
   
   Message:
   {{message}}
   ```

### Add Spam Protection
1. Go to **"Settings"** → **"Security"**
